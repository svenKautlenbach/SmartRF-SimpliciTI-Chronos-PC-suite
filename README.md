Chronos based network system PC tools
===================================

This software was developed during the master thesis at Tallinn University of Technology to interface the CC430 low power radio network. 

There are two tools:
1) Network interface and access point control tool.
2) SmartRF packet sniffer "psd" log to CSV converter.


Note:
All license and rights BS is not specified, except where Texas Instruments makes its claims.
The code has awful style and readability, since one does not have much time to craft beautiful software during the thesis work.
